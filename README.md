# Machine Learning project
-Objective: Use past email click data from 2020 to find and target users who might be interested in our upcoming TV promotion.

- Built a predictive model using scikit-learnâ€™s Pipeline and ColumnTransformer to transform numerical features (age,purchase amount, time spent) and categorical features (user badges)

-Utilized SimpleImputer to handle missing data, applied categorical mean to missing values

-Used StandardScalar and OneHotEncoder to prepare data for logistic regression classification

-Developed custom method to combine user interaction data and integrated it into a logistic model to predict future behavioral interactions
